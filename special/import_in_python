=>Importing in Python is the process of bringing external modules, libraries, 
  or specific parts of them into your Python program. This allows you to reuse
  code and access functions, classes, and variables from other files or
  built-in libraries without having to rewrite them.

->Importing an Entire Module:
       >import <name>
       ex:import math


-> Importing Specific Functions or Classes:
       >from <name> import <specific <name>>
       ex:from math import sqrt


->Importing with an Alias:
       >import <name> as <required name>
        ex:import numpy as np
    

->Importing with *:
       >from <name> import *
       ->>Avoid Using from module import *:
          This can lead to naming conflicts and make code harder to debug.

->Importing custom module:
        >import <module name>


**we have dir() function which gives the details of functions and variabkes that a module have
